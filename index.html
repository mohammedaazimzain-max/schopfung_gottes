    <p id="erstengedicht"><b><h1><u>Overlooked Favors</u></h1></strong></b><br> 
From the first breath of life<br>
To the soulful last,<br>
And each and every unnoticed breath in middle<br>
Accompanied by every overlooked beat of the heart<br>
Keeping us alive, rejuvenated.<br>
Were we Grateful?<br>
Did we even notice?<br>
From every stress laden palpitation <br>
To every relieved sigh,<br>
Were we grateful?<br>
Have we ever fallen into Prostration?<br>
Out of mere Gratitude<br>
To the One, Most Glorious,<br>
To the One whom praises belong,<br>
To the One who feeds the disabled,<br>
To the One who gives drink to the Desert Traveller,<br>
To the One who fosters the Orphans,<br>
To the One who keeps ships afloat,<br>
To the One who has erected mountains,<br>
Balanced the sky onto firm, invisible pillars.<br>
To the One who provides bread,<br>
Water to nourish,<br>
Homes to rest.<br>
Nay, we persisted in our arrogance,<br>
Dwelled in our ignorance,<br>
Blind to the Favors,<br>
Ingratitude and Pride were our Mentors.<br> 
Till when?<br>
All it would take is a <br>
Single, Mighty Blast,<br>
To unshroud the shrouded Truth.<br>
To reveal what we thought to be<br>
Merely “coincidence”<br>
But The Creator is<br>
Oft-Forgiving, Eternally Loving.<br>
Batting a blind eye<br>
To our misdeeds,<br>
Each and Every time.<br>
Return back.<br>
After all who do we think we are?<br></p>

<p id="zweitengedicht"><h1><u>Enchanting Lives</u></h1>Many a night spent in lonely somberness, <br>
Pondering over the purpose of existence. <br>
Why is it that I am alive? <br>
What is my purpose?<br>
 Questions that cannot be answered until death grasp us.<br>
Fundamentally speaking,<br>
We are members of humanity,<br>
Allies to Justice, <br>
We do commit mistakes, but we learn.<br>
Most times we fall for our wrong, but then, a minute later,<br>
We rise better. <br>
We shatter due to sadness, break under unattainable expectations,<br>
But we also forge ourselves with unending reliability on God alone.<br>
Nothing hurts, until we allow it to.<br>
We are Family, facing the same set of problems, worried by the same fears,<br>
But we do overcome it, right?<br>
Cause its necessary for the sun to rise again, to shine out the dark. <br>
Just like our hopes.<br>
Fears fade, worries allay, <br>
Happiness blossoms like tulip buds. <br>
It’s just a matter of Time!<br>

    <h1> <u>The Eventuality Of End</u></h1><br>
To death what do we say?<br> 
Maybe later, perhaps another hour? <br>
But does it ever wait for you to get ready?<br>
It knows you never want to get ready right?<br>
Then why lose this moment? <br>
We know we won’t get it back. <br>
What is lost is lost forever. <br>
Time is merciless. <br>
Time something abstract that we physicalize to cogs and dials to fool ourselves by pretending it is controllable. <br>
But how can it be controlled when it appears as an indication that our planet is at a different spatial coordinate <br>
in the world of gigantic spheres and clouds of raging matter. <br>
We are just a speck of no consideration. <br>
What differentiates us is that we have life.<br>
Something rarer than our conceivability of minutely probable outcomes. <br>
Then why waste time? <br>
Why live chaotically?<br>
Why scurry away from the sweet release of death.<br> 
Why not embrace its eventual arrival after all it is just another journey of life. <br>
Why worry when God promises gardens under which rivers flow. <br>
Then why ache and toil under the illusion of worry and uncertainty. <br>
Everything is registered in a perfect record. <br>
LIVE! <br>
But live to do the right thing. <br>
Live like it’s your last day. <br>
Live faithfully and toil away striving for righteousness to please God. <br>
After all it is because of Him why you and I are alive and happy.<br>

<h1><u>An Extract From "Four Millennia"</u></h1><br>
The unheard wails of the fallen corpses, the mother clinging to her children, hovering above them to protect them from the murderous bombshells. All whilst their father marches towards the enemy trenches, uncertain about himself and his family’s fate. Unbeknownst to him they had perished long before himself. He hallucinates with fluttering images of his family, he knows that this is only natural since he is walking towards his death and that God being the Most Merciful allows him a final view of his family till their reunification on Judgement Day.  He solidifies himself with a final dosage of courage, hopeful for a chance to get back home to see his children once again and with adrenalin coursing through his veins of masculinity, determined, he marches towards the enemy trench with each step reaffirming his resolve to hold no quarter. He has the foreboding that he will die but reassuring himself, he chooses to fight with honor rather than to show his back and flee like a coward with his tail between his scarred legs, he exhibits this valiant show of bravery so much so that his enemies, confused seeing his solitary figure end up enamoring over his unwavering spirit as their bullets graze his person. They halt their bullet show and gaze at the man’s ferocious visage. Honor is respected with Honor. One of them climbs up, salutes and holds a rifle aiming for his head. The father sees but chuckles a phlegmatic sarcastic smirk mixed with a tinge of respect back at him. Never did the thought of raising his arms and bending down on his bony and scarred knees ever crossed his aching and bloodied head. Respecting his opponent’s wish, he does the same. Turns out the momentary standoff couldn’t have been farer than a classic American cowboy showdown. Their rifles in their hands, not knowing who falls, they shoot. A second later the father falls down but with a self-approved smile drawing on his dusty face. The enemies know that he is the last man to die in this bloody war, they climb up from their muddy trenches, walk towards the dead man, salute him and bury him with imaginary accolades of bravery and determination exhibited in the most dire of times where the hope of survival rarely flickers. He rests in his grave, the fragrance of paradise entering into his nostrils. The dead are not dead especially the martyred ones.
